# UFOs

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage to visualize UFO sighting data from a JavaScript file and to analyze the data to discover similarities or patterns.

## Results
![ufo_filter_1](C:\Users\Brandon\Desktop\ufo_filter_1.PNG)

The user can filter the data by using inputting a date in the date filter. 

![ufo_filter_2]("C:\Users\Brandon\Desktop\ufo_filter_2.PNG")

The user can filter by using multiple filters.

## Summary
- One drawback would be that there is no filter button anymore. The user doesn't have control over when the table filters anymore because it is now automatic. If they want to use filter by three different inputs, the table will update after each one instead of once after all three have been put in.
- I would recommend another filter that filters by keyword in the comment column.
- My second recommendation would be to align the filter input boxes for a more organized look. I'd also capitalize the names of the cities and state abbreviations to look a little more professional.
